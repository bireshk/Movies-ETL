# Movies ETL using pandas and postgressSQL
## Overview analysis
The objective of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that takes in data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into postgressSQL tables. This analysis takes 3 inputs â€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and then performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
